# PCUAAE
PCUAE has just had a baby, its called PCUAAE - Project Carousel USB Amiga Anniversary Edition.

Project Carousel USB Amiga Anniversary Edition(PCUAAE) for THE A500 Mini. PCUAAE Autoboot Start-up Script v1.0.0. PCUAAE - Manhattan Skyline v1.0.0/1.1.1

This is for THE A500 Mini or THE A500 Maxi, Its early days yet, THEA500 Mini was released on the 8th April 2022 and not everyone has got there's yet but just wanted to put this out there that this it been made and will get better in time as we learn more about the machine.

And as mods get made for it, I will try and add them to it.

This will be like PCUAE and use some of it, I will port some of the stuff from it to this, I will not be porting the carousel from THEC64, it was not made for this machine and it should stay on the machine it meant to be for, THE A500 Mini has its own carousel and I do not need to turn it into THEC66.
